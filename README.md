# Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis seeks to automatically reveal our underlying attitudes toward a given object. Opinion surveying is the process of combining these sentiments across a population and has several uses. Currently available methods for text-based sentiment analysis rely on machine learning models that learn sentiment from huge text corpora and dictionary creation. Sentiment analysis from text is currently widely utilized for a variety of purposes, including brand perception study and customer satisfaction evaluation. Social media's widespread use is expected to open up new possibilities for multimodal sentiment analysis by introducing complementary data streams that will enable it to advance beyond text-based sentiment analysis. Multimodal sentiment analysis presents interesting ways to analyze not only the transcript or textual content but also the visual and vocal emotions that are left behind as affective traces of sentiment. These methods use context inference and emotion detection to ascertain the degree and underlying polarity of a person's attitude. This survey aims to provide an overview of sentiment and the multimodal sentiment analysis challenge. It also covers recent advancements in multimodal sentiment analysis across several domains, such as spoken  reviews, photos, video blogs, human-machine, and human-human interactions. We also address the opportunities and challenges of this developing subject, which leads us to the conclusion that multimodal sentiment analysis has a great deal of unrealized potential.
